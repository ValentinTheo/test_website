  <h3>Non-linear Corporate Income Tax: Learning, Intensive and Extensive Margins</h3>
  <p><i>
    This paper provides new evidence on how firms learn corporate tax reforms and how the
latter affects both business creation and firm splitting. I exploit a reform in France that replaced
the pre-reform linear corporate tax with a progressive bracketed system. Drawing on rich tax
administrative data and a unique feature of them, I find that firms, on average, took 4 years to
understand the tax reform. The year of the reform, the fraction of firms making mistakes on their
tax amount increased by 40pp. This mislearning implied an overpayment to the tax administration
of 5,5% of firms’ taxable income on average, which can reach more than 8% for small firms.
Larger and more profitable firms learn faster as well as more financially literate business owners.
When responses have stabilized, I rely on the bunching at the discontinuity to estimate an elasticity
of reported taxable income of 0.4. Furthermore, I rely on the discontinuity of the reform and on a
two-way fixed effects estimation to measure the extent of both business creation and firm splitting
through incorporation. I find both a large response of business creation and a high sensitivity
of incorporation. My findings highlight the delay in behavioral responses due to learning, the
difference between the real and reported taxable income elasticity and the importance of extensive
margins in the welfare effect of tax reforms.

  <h3>Charitable Giving, Tax Design, and Tax Consent</h3>
  <p><i>
    This paper examines how the design of tax incentives shapes charitable giving and how non-monetary motives
influence such responses. We exploit the French institutional context, where a wealth tax has existed for decades, and
study three reforms: one that introduced a wealth tax credit for charitable donations and two that altered taxpayers’
eligibility for the wealth tax. Our analysis relies on comprehensive French administrative panel data linking the
universe of income tax returns with the universe of wealth tax returns, containing detailed information on income,
wealth, taxation, and charitable contributions. We document substantial heterogeneity in giving behavior across
the tax schedule and develop a conceptual framework to interpret this heterogeneity. Exploiting variation from the
reforms, we identify the mechanisms driving behavioral responses. We find strong attachment to charitable giving:
despite the availability of lower marginal gift prices, many wealth taxpayers deliberately continue to give at higher
marginal prices. We also provide evidence of differential tax aversion depending on the tax base. Finally, using the
most recent reform, we estimate a tax-price elasticity of total charitable giving of –0.51 among wealth taxpayers.
